[0] create a pair of keys (private key, public key pair)
$ ./create_keys.sh


[1] prepare an original text file
$ echo "hello, world" > orig.txt


[2] encrypt the original file
$ ./encrypt_file.sh orig.txt

then `enc_out.txt` will be created. you can't see the original text in this file.


[3] decrypt the encrypted file so that you can see the original text
$ ./decrypt_file.sh enc_out.txt

then, `dec_out.txt` will be created. this file has exactly same data wtih the original file(orig.txt)


[4] clear all immediate files
$ ./clean.sh

then, *.txt, *.key files will be deleted
